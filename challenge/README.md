# Theater Funding Campaign Outcomes on Kickstarter

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

This analysis is meant to show the relationship between Kickstarter funding goals and their launch dates for theater campaigns. It will help determine when are the best times to launch a kickstarter, and the funding goal amount that is most likely to be met.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

The following graph shows how successful funding campaigns were based on the month they were launched. This looks at all data for theater campaigns between 2010 and 2017 for Kickstarter and totals the number of successful, failed or canceled campaigns by month.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

The following graph shows what percent of campaigns were successful based on the funding amount requested. This graph groups the amount of funding requested for campaigns into broader tiers, and compares those against the outcome of the campaign to come up with the percentage of succesful, failed, or canceled in that tier.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

When analyzing this data you may encounter some difficulty converting the currency values, so that they are all displayed in a single currency.

## Results

Based on this analysis, the ideal time of the year to launch a theater campaign on Kickstarter is during June, and July. Those months saw double the number of successful campaigns versus unsuccessful ones. It also indicates that January is the worst month to launch a campaign, with nearly 50% falling short of their funding goals.

All funding amounts of 10,000 or less were met more than 50% of the time. Funding amounts of 1,000 or less showed the greatest rate of success, at more than 70%.

Additional insight could be gained by showing the influence of Kickstarts "Staff Picks", and "Spotlight" features on funding.

The data used in this analysis only draws from a single crowdfunding source, Kickstarter. It treats all currencies as equal in the outcomes based on Goals. The data used covers the years 2010 to 2017, so it does not show the most recent years funding trends.
