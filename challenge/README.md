## Results

Based on this analysis, the ideal time of the year to launch a theater campaign on Kickstarter is during June, and July. Those months saw double the number of successful campaigns versus unsuccessful ones. It also indicates that January is the worst month to launch a campaign, with nearly 50% falling short of their funding goals.

All funding amounts of 10,000 or less were met more than 50% of the time. Funding amounts of 1,000 or less showed the greatest rate of success, at more than 70%.

Additional insight could be gained by showing the influence of Kickstarts "Staff Picks", and "Spotlight" features on funding.

The data used in this analysis only draws from a single crowdfunding source, Kickstarter. It treats all currencies as equal in the outcomes based on Goals.
