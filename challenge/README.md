# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose

This analysis is meant to show the relationship between Kickstarter funding goals and their launch dates for theater campaigns. It will help determine when are the best times to launch a kickstarter, and the funding goal amount that is most likely to be met.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

* July is the best month to launch. Having more than double the number of succesful campaigns vs failed ones.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

* $10,000 or less was better than 50% successful at being funded.
* For higher values; 40,000 to 49,999 was at 49% successful and failed less often than any value between 5,000 and 39,999 (under 40%).

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

## Results

Based on this analysis, the ideal time of the year to launch a theater campaign on Kickstarter is during the summer months. July being the best month overall. All funding amounts of $10,000 or less were met more than 50% of the time. However, for the greatest chance of success the funding amount should be $5,000 or less. Which was fully funded more than 70% of the time.

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?

- What are some limitations of this dataset?

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
